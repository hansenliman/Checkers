# Checkers

Welcome! This project is made by me, Hansen Liman, and my partner, Matthew Harrison. We divided the work into two portions: I made the AI which takes in a board state in a string format, and uses the Minimax algorithm to predict 3 steps ahead, which move leads to the most optimal state. On the other hand, Matthew created the wrapper for the AI which interacts with the board and the human player.

To access the code, go to Game.py. You can run the code, which would then run the game through the console, and the game will pick up inputs from there.
